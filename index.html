<p>This is a collection of loosely connected, ever-evolving notes on topics that I care about. My inspiration for starting a digital garden came from reading a beautiful introduction by Maggie Appleton. If you're interested in learning more about this concept, you should read her &quot;<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the idea of escaping the tyranny of chronological feeds with their unceasing battle for immediate attention, where posts are rarely remembered or re-read. This feels liberating. Even more freeing is the idea that notes don't need to be polished as everything in the digital garden is a work in progress.</p>
