        <p>On this page, I'm collecting my notes about academia. When writing these notes, I imagine talking to an aspiring or an early career researcher, or maybe to someone outside academia who is curious about its inner workings. I suspect that experienced researchers might not find much new here. I'm trying to speak a bit more open than is typically seen. This is part of my effort to reduce the gap between those fortunate enough to have been exposed to the hidden curriculum of academia and those who haven't had such opportunities.</p>
